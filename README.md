# Neovim settings

Neovim (https://github.com/neovim/neovim) is an ambitious vim-fork, that 
provides a better plugin API than vim, better codebase, a great community and some very useful features. 
These settings provide a comfortable neovim experience, with only 2 lightweight plugins.

## Prerequisites
* neovim v0.5

## Configuration
* Replace local nvim folder with the folder from these settings.
	- Type `:echo stdpath('config')` in the editor to get the path to your nvim directory (On linux usually `~/.config/nvim` and on windows usually `~/AppData/Local/nvim`).
* Editor will automatically install plugins on start. You can disable this by deleting lines under plugins in `init.vim` and manually install with `:PlugInstall`.
* See [config](docs/CONFIG.md) on how to configure formaters, interpreters and compilers for different filetypes, how to create snippets and add language servers.

## Details
On start up, neovim first reads settings from `init.vim`, which contains plugins and filetype-specific configurations, 
then it goes through other settings split into multiple files in `nvim/plugin` folder.

See [details](docs/DETAILS.md) for more information on the specific file's contents.

### Pluggins
* nvim-lspconfig (https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) - collection of common configurations for LSP.
* Completion-nvim (https://github.com/nvim-lua/completion-nvim) - auto completion framework for a better completion experience with LSP.

Plugins are managed with Vim-Plug (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).
- It is installed under `nvim/autoload`. If plugins are not installed on launch and command `:PlugInstall` does not exist, try reinstalling vim-plug from it's GitHub repository.


### LSP
Nvim supports the Language Server Protocol (LSP), which means it acts as
a client to LSP servers and includes a Lua framework `vim.lsp` for building
enhanced LSP tools.

* See [details](docs/DETAILS.md) and [config](docs/CONFIG.md) for more on adding language servers.
